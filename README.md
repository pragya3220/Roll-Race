<h1><strong>Roll & Race- The fun way!! by Pragya , Roll no. : 21051424</strong></h1>
Roll & Race is a Web based game made completely using HTML, CSS and Javascript. In this game there are total 4 players and each one has 4 pieces and each one has to roll the dice and whatever points he/she got has to move their piece on the board, at the end each piece ends up returning to the home at the center of the board, whoever made all his pieces to the home first got First postion and so on.
so , basically this is the fun way as we were instructed to make the game fun , so i have added quite a many features in the game :
>> created the whole new board from scratch with pices of triangular shape and not circular!
>> added 2 dices instead of 1 to make it more fun , so the player has to first click on the place where "click" is written then the dices will be rolled, and then you have to click the piece which you have to move and move exactly the no. of boxes as indicated in the dice
>> added the reset button
>> added the roll button
>> added the background music 
>> added the background
>> added the instructions and the rules to play 
>> and also made the stop signs as star(as it was used to be in the board game we played in our childhood)
